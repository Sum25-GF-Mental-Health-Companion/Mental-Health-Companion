## üß± Architecture
### Static view diagram
You can access the diagram at [docs/architecture/MHC_static_view](https://github.com/Sum25-GF-Mental-Health-Companion/Mental-Health-Companion/blob/329de58270d14e2d5dcf010f64890b04010dd629/docs/architecture/MHC_static_view.png)

#### Diagram Explanation:
* Frontend (Flutter):
  * Includes key UI screens like LoginScreen, SessionScreen, SessionHistory, and SummaryScreen.
  * Subcomponents like ChatInput and TimerWidget are embedded in relevant views.
  * These screens interact with the backend to perform authentication, initiate chat sessions, and retrieve session summaries.
* Backend (Go + Fiber):
  * Composed of controllers: AuthController, SessionController, and MessageController, each responsible for handling corresponding routes.
  * The JWTMiddleware ensures that only authenticated users access protected endpoints.
  * MessageController delegates message handling to the LLMClient, which communicates with an external AI service (e.g., Claude API) to simulate therapeutic responses.
  * SummaryService handles the generation and saving of session summaries.
* Database (PostgreSQL):
  * Stores all persistent data: users, sessions, messages, and summaries.
  * Each controller interacts with the appropriate table to read/write data.
* External APIs:
  * The LLMClient can connect to external large language model APIs such as Claude or OpenAI, to generate responses and session summaries based on recent user messages.
 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

* Flutter + Riverpod
* Go + Fiber
* PostgreSQL + Goose
* OpenAI API / Claude API
* Docker + GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure
Paste after finishing project

## üß† LLM Context Strategy

* Fetches summaries of last 50sessions 
* Sends to LLM with user message for reply + summary generation

## üöÄ Deployment
* Flutter Web: Vercel / GitHub Pages
* Backend: Railway / Render / Fly.io
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Lint, Test, Docker Build/Push)

## üôå Team
* Damir - LLM integration
* Vladimir - Flutter app
* Syoma - Flutter app + project deployment
* Magomed - server API 
* Pavel - Database + documentation

## üîÆ Future Plans
- [ ] Add a local LLM support via Ollama API
- [ ] Introduce notifications about an everyday session
- [ ] Enhance the communication wrapping a user message
