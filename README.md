## üß± Architecture

### Static View Diagram
You can access the diagram at [docs/architecture/MHC_static_view](https://github.com/Sum25-GF-Mental-Health-Companion/Mental-Health-Companion/blob/329de58270d14e2d5dcf010f64890b04010dd629/docs/architecture/MHC_static_view.png)

#### Diagram Explanation:
* Frontend (Flutter):
  * Includes key UI screens like LoginScreen, SessionScreen, SessionHistory, and SummaryScreen.
  * Subcomponents like ChatInput and TimerWidget are embedded in relevant views.
  * These screens interact with the backend to perform authentication, initiate chat sessions, and retrieve session summaries.
* Backend (Go + Fiber):
  * Composed of controllers: AuthController, SessionController, and MessageController, each responsible for handling corresponding routes.
  * The JWTMiddleware ensures that only authenticated users access protected endpoints.
  * MessageController delegates message handling to the LLMClient, which communicates with an external AI service (e.g., Claude API) to simulate therapeutic responses.
  * SummaryService handles the generation and saving of session summaries.
* Database (PostgreSQL):
  * Stores all persistent data: users, sessions, messages, and summaries.
  * Each controller interacts with the appropriate table to read/write data.
* External APIs:
  * The LLMClient can connect to external large language model APIs such as Claude or OpenAI, to generate responses and session summaries based on recent user messages.
 
### Dynamic View Diagram
You can access the diagram at [docs/architecture/MHC_dynamic_view](https://github.com/Sum25-GF-Mental-Health-Companion/Mental-Health-Companion/blob/4a9664571118bb356634a3e6c5191a8430acb6fc/docs/architecture/MHC_dynamic_view.png)

#### Diagram Explanation
This diagram illustrates the real-time communication workflow from the moment a user sends a message until the AI responds.

1) User Interaction:
   * The user types a message and presses "Send" in the ChatInput widget of the Flutter frontend.
   
2) Frontend ‚Üí Backend Request:
   * A POST /message request is sent to the MessageController (Go backend) with the session_id and the user's message.
    
3) Backend Processing ‚Äì Save & Context Building:
   * The message is saved to the messages table in PostgreSQL with sender='user'.
   * All previous messages from the current session are fetched to maintain contextual continuity.
   * Additionally, the backend retrieves the last 20 summary records (from previous sessions) to give the AI broader conversation history.

4) LLM Interaction:
   * The LLMClient composes a prompt that includes:
     * Full session context
     * Compressed summaries
     * The latest user message
   * It sends this prompt to the Calude.

5) AI Response Handling:
   * Claude responds with a generated reply.
   * The backend logs this response in the messages table with sender='ai'.

6) Response Delivery:
   * The AI's reply is sent back to the frontend.
   * The Flutter UI displays the AI response in the chat.
